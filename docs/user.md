## KYC Process

KYC (Know Your Customer) is an essential process in financial services and investment platforms like the Fracsials Investor Dashboard. It involves verifying the identity of users to ensure compliance with regulations and prevent fraud. Here's an overview of the KYC process:

### 1. Submission of KYC Details

- Users must choose the type of KYC document they want to submit. Currently, we are only allowing the submission of a U.S. driving license.
- Users are required to submit personal information such as their first name, last name, date of birth as per government-issued identification documents which should be submitted along.
- The KYC form typically includes fields for users to input this information accurately.

### 2. Document Verification

- Once the user submits their personal information, the platform's AI system performs the first level of verification by comparing the provided documents with the submitted details.
- If the AI verification is successful, the documents are then forwarded to a platform agent for the second level of verification.
- The agent verifies the authenticity of the provided documents and ensures that the user's identity matches the information provided.

#### Important Note:

- **Mandatory KYC Completion/Approval**: Users will not be able to invest in any properties or participate in investment pools without KYC Completion/Approval. Completing KYC is a mandatory step to ensure the security and compliance of the platform.
